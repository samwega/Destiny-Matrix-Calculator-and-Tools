It encodes the date in the URL so it can be linked or shared.

"reset date" loads the to current date, and the arrows "<<" and ">>" load the previous and next day's date.

The years around the octagon move in 1.25 increments, which is 15 months, or 1 year and 3 months.

Hovering over any of the numbers displays the name of the respective tarot card. Destiny Matrix uses the Marseille tarot sequence, which has Justice in the 8th place and Strength in the 11th, the reverse of the more commonly used Rider Waite tarot deck sequence.

This was all coded with AI Studio's Gemini 2.5 and functionality was later added in Windsurf with GPT 4.1.

# Core Number On Birthday Lister

I was intrigued by how the Core number during our birthday changes and repeats on a 9 year cycle, so I made this little calculator. You can check out a live version here [Core Number On Every Birthday](https://glavans.com/apps/core_birthday_lister.html).

# Destiny Matrix Research Tool

Simple html + css + javascript one file webapp for calculating certain Destiny Matrix chart patterns over arbitrary periods. That means you can _simply_ download the html file and run it in your browser.

It iterates through every date between two input dates, covering even thousands of years at a time, and matching the Core number (the central number in a DM chart), or the Life Purpose number (a.k.a. Destiny), or even both at the same time, displaying a percentage representation of the frequency of those numbers as well as their overlap. Certain numbers are very rare, others a lot more common, and the same goes for combinations, which is what I wanted to study.

You can run every date between two dates without setting up Target Core/Destiny numbers, but this is limited to 130 years so the server doesn't crash. If you need any more than that, you can iterate. When running with Target Core/Destiny numbers, this is capped at 2501 years. I was able to run 5000 years on my laptop, but at 10,000 years I crashed my browser.

I find the Heart and Heart's desire (the green bubbles, a.k.a. Heart chakra) are very significant, and whyle I didn't think it was useful to target them directly with the search, I find it more useful to paste them (for example "3â†’14") in your browser's search (Ctrl+F) and get a count or navigate them to see the frequency, patterns, etc.

You can play with the app here:
