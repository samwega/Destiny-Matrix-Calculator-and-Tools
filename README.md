Simple html + css + javascript one file webapp for calculating certain Destiny Matrix chart patterns over arbitrary periods. That means you can _simply_ download the html file and run it in your browser.

It iterates through every date between two input dates, covering even thousands of years at a time, and matching the Core number (the central number in a DM chart), or the Life Purpose number (a.k.a. Destiny), or even both at the same time, displaying a percentage representation of the frequency of those numbers as well as their overlap. Certain numbers are very rare, others a lot more common, and the same goes for combinations, which is what I wanted to study.

You can run every date between two dates without setting up Target Core/Destiny numbers, but this is limited to 130 years so the server doesn't crash. If you need any more than that, you can iterate. When running with Target Core/Destiny numbers, this is capped at 2501 years. I was able to run 5000 years on my laptop, but at 10,000 years I crashed my browser.

I find the Heart and Heart's desire (the green bubbles, a.k.a. Heart chakra) are very significant, and whyle I didn't think it was useful to target them directly with the search, I find it more useful to paste them (for example "3â†’14") in your browser's search (Ctrl+F) and get a count or navigate them to see the frequency, patterns, etc.
