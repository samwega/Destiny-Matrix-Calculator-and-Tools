It encodes the date in the URL so it can be linked or shared.

"reset date" loads the to current date, and the arrows "<<" and ">>" load the previous and next day's date.

The years around the octagon move in 1.25 increments, which is 15 months, or 1 year and 3 months.

Hovering over any of the numbers displays the name of the respective tarot card. Destiny Matrix uses the Marseille tarot sequence, which has Justice in the 8th place and Strength in the 11th, the reverse of the more commonly used Rider Waite tarot deck sequence.

This was all coded with AI Studio's Gemini 2.5 and functionality was later added in Windsurf with GPT 4.1.

Feel free to request additional functionality.
