Simple html + css + javascript one file webapp for calculating Destiny Matrix charts. That means you can _simply_ download the html file and run it in your browser.

It encodes the date in the URL so it can be linked or shared.

"reset date" loads the to current date, and the arrows "<<" and ">>" load the previous and next day's date.

The years around the octagon move in 1.25 increments, which is 15 months, or 1 year and 3 months.

Hovering over any of the numbers displays the name of the respective tarot card. Destiny Matrix uses the Marseille tarot sequence, which has Justice in the 8th place and Strength in the 11th, the reverse of the more commonly used Rider Waite tarot deck sequence.

This was all coded with AI Studio's Gemini 2.5 and functionality was later added in Windsurf with GPT 4.1.

I've also included a standalone little app, the Core Birthday Listerâ€”I was intrigued by how the Core number during our birthday changes and repeats on a 9 year cycle, so I made this little calculator. You can check out a live version here [Core Number On Every Birthday](https://glavans.com/apps/core_birthday_lister.html).
